Vanilla game style skill swapper. Easy to config and use. You can use your second skill set just like vanilla game - Hold Switch Weapon Skill key(Second one) and cast the skills.


## Change log
v1.1.1
Remove rearm skill from the alternative skillset. 


## Difference with other skill swapper mod 

It is more like an in-game 8 skill slots, instead of rotating the existing 4 skill slot. It wont break the skill context in game.

It seems there are some bugs cannot be solved in the way I use before.
So I uploaded a new version(1.1.0), which use skill set rotation just like the other mods. 

Like the mod name, it is an alternative one. Just in case it can fulfil someone needs.

## Installation

Download the mod file, Drag the zip to Fluffy or Unzip to the game folder.
Make sure 
1. AnAlternativeSkillSwapper.lua located in gamefolder\reframework\autorun

## How to use (For 1.1.0)

Due to some changes to this mod. This section has updated. It's much simpler than before.

For both keyboard and controller users

1. Press insert to open ReFramework UI
2. Go for Script Generated UI -> An Alternative Skill Swapper
3. Set the modifier key. It should be different with with your primary switch key.
4. Fill some skills you like to the alternative skill set.
5. Try it out. It should be working like this

For people just want it to work like this, can go back to game & have fun.

For those people who want to use a SINGLE key to trigger you secondary skill read the following:

For keyboard users:
1. Set a secondary key to Switch Weapon Skill in GAME settings
2. Use the key you set in step1 as the modifier key
3. Done

For controller users:
1. Set a secondary key(let's say key Z for example) like keyboard users.
2. Find a way to remap a button on your controller to keyboard(Key Z in this case). You may refer this video to learn how to set it by steam input.
3. Set the modifier key with your controller button you just set(Should be Z in this case).
4. In game settings, set your modifier key(controller button, not Key Z) with a Run or Camera or anything won't block skill casting.
5. Done.

There are some samples in mod images.
